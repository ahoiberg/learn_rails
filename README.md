# learn_rails
a guide to learning ruby on rails

This repository is meant to be a beginner's guide to learning how the internet works and how to make rails apps. Feel free to clone it, fork it, do whatever you want.

Start by installing Ruby and Rails: http://installrails.com/
Note that Rails is designed to be "convention over configuration." Everything is designed to be the same, I can't set up my Rails server different than yours, which makes it easier to understand anyone else's rails app.

The internet works through the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, http. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
tl;dr you make a request to some server someplace (at google, facebook, amazon, tripadvisor, etc), and the server sends a response: either the information you want (typically a webpage), or an error message.

Within something like Rails, you have a lot of CRUD. CRUD is:
Create
Read
Update
Delete

Rails uses what is known as MVC, Model-View-Controller. Since this is a short presentation, MVC means that you view your Models (essentially your data) in Views (the webpages themselves) via Controllers. More information exists online, look it up if interested.
